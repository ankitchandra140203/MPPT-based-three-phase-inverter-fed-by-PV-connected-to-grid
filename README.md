# MPPT based three phase inverter fed by PV connected to grid
 Three phase inverter will transfer maximum active power by controliing  phase with the help of controllers
Photovoltaic (PV) system aimed at generating solar power from PV panels, which inherently produce DC power. In this project, I have employed a 3-phase AC inverter to convert the DC power into 3-phase AC power, suitable for integration into the grid. Furthermore, I have developed a controller, inspired by research papers, to regulate the active power injection into the grid. This controller endeavors to minimize the phase difference between the generated voltage and current from the 3-phase inverter.
